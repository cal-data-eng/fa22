Hi! I'm a second year PhD student from the Bay Area researching programming languages for distributed systems. I'm a golden bear for life, and studied EECS as an undergrad here as well! In my free time, you'll find me cooking new dishes in my Instant Pot, going on hikes, or playing k-pop maps in Beat Saber.
